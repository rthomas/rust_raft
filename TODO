Overview:

- tokio-base impl to provide the building blocks for utilizing a raft impl.
 - These will consist of a `core` compoenent that provides the actual implementation; and
 - A client library that the followers can use to send RPCs to the leader
- This split should allow requests to be sent to any node and processed on the leader.

Components:

- tokio-raft
 - raft-client
  - Manages connections from any node to leader & client RPC ID
 - raft-core
  - Raft implementation

Plan:

- Initial framework
 - Determine RPC process and log representation
  - Capnproto?
 - Leader election & timeout
  - Simple key-value log in-memory

- Configuration changes

- Snapshotting
 - Disk persistance
