Overview:

- tokio-base impl to provide the building blocks for utilizing a raft impl.
 - These will consist of a `core` compoenent that provides the actual implementation; and
 - A client library that the followers can use to send RPCs to the leader
- This split should allow requests to be sent to any node and processed on the leader.

Components:

- tokio-raft
 - raft-client
  - Manages connections from any node to leader & client RPC ID
 - raft-core
  - Raft implementation

Plan:

- capnp-rpc seems to work well
- Need to:
 - Flesh out the RPCs into actually doing something
 - Build up a client lib for making the calls - this will then be what
   does the location of the current master (i.e. redirects).
 - Snapshotting
  - The capnp LogEntry items will be easy to persist to disk... however
    they're not currently stored as that in the RaftServer so that snapshotting
    will need to convert them to the proto format before streaming them out.
